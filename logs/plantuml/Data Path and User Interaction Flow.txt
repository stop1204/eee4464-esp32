  :Publish sensor data via MQTT to Cloudflare;
fork again
  :Send HTTP requests for control and additional data;
end fork

:Cloudflare Worker receives and processes data;
:Cloudflare stores data in database;

:Web Dashboard queries Cloudflare for real-time and historical data;
:User views data and sends control commands via web interface;
